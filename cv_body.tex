\objective{Objective}{%
I am looking to use my skills and  %collaboration skills and 
 experience %working with diverse collaborations from around the wor
in programming,  analysis, and collaboration %tical skill 
to contribute to acoustic simulations at the Naval Research Laboratory.
 My  15 years of experience  as an experimental 
 nuclear physicist 
have required me to acquire a wide variety of %many diverse 
skills.
Specifically, these skills include 
%as an experimental physicist
%specializing in the 
the writing and development of computer code for the acquisition, calibration, simulation, and analysis of nuclear %experimental 
data;
 % from nuclear physics experiments. 
comparing simulations to experimental data;
comparing data to physical models; 
and working with diverse collaborations to report and evaluate the analysis and results of experiments.
I am interested in leveraging my education, experience, and skills to help further the practical research and development at NRL
and transition the results into operational use.
